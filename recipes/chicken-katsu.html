    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>

        <ul class="lists">
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>

        <ol class ="lists">
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
